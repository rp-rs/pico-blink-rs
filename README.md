Running Rust code on the Raspberry Pi Pico

## Booting

The RP2040 has external QSPI flash. There is an internal mask-ROM bootloader which can read the first 256 bytes of 
external flash and copy it to the top of SRAM (`0x2004_1f00`). This 256 byte block is the 'second stage bootloader'. 
Its job is to reconfigure the XIP_SSI interface to the right values for the attached QSPI flash chip (the mask ROM has 
some very conservative defaults which should work with all chips), and configure the XIP so that the QSPI flash appears 
at address `0x1000_0000` upwards.

The second stage bootloader then loads the user application once the XIP_SSI configuration is complete. It does this by 
reading a vector table at `0x1000_0100`, which is 256 bytes into the QSPI flash contents (or immediately after the 256 
byte second stage bootloader), and jumping to the reset vector.

We should also write a BSP for the pico, and a HAL for the RP2040. Basically, don't do any of what I did here. But hey, 
it blinks!
